solution:-
Firstly we take one small block= 8*8
Secondly, group of four blocks=7*7
Third, group of nine blocks=6*6
Fourth, group of 16 blocks=5*5
Fifth, group of 25 blocks=4*4
Sixth, group of 36 block=3*3
Seventh, group of 49 blocks=2*2
Eighth, group of 64 block=1

Total Blocks are=8*8+7*7+6*6+5*5+4*4+3*3+2*2+1=204
